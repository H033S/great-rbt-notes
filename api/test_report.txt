RBT met with the client, [client-name], and the client’s caregiver, [caregiver-name], at the previously agreed-upon time at [place-of-service]. The session commenced with the client engaging in structured and play-based activities as outlined in the behavior intervention plan.

During the session, two instances of maladaptive behavior were observed.

First, when the client was instructed to transition from a preferred activity to a non-preferred task, the client engaged in loud vocal protests, including yelling and crying. This behavior lasted for approximately three minutes. In response, the RBT implemented differential reinforcement of alternative behavior (DRA) by prompting the client to use functional communication to request a short break. The caregiver was also instructed to withhold attention until the client used an appropriate request. After two additional prompts, the client requested a break using a verbal phrase and was allowed a one-minute break before resuming the task. As a result, the client completed the non-preferred task with minimal additional prompting.

Later in the session, when denied access to a tangible item, the client engaged in aggressive behavior, including hitting and kicking. The behavior persisted for approximately four minutes. In response, the RBT implemented an extinction procedure by not providing access to the requested item while redirecting the client to an alternative activity. The caregiver followed the same procedure by maintaining a neutral response. After the client calmed, the RBT prompted the client to request the item appropriately, which the client did after one additional verbal model. The client was then given access to the item for two minutes as reinforcement for appropriate requesting behavior.

Throughout the session, the client was provided with token reinforcement for task completion. Upon earning the required number of tokens, the client was allowed access to a preferred activity for five minutes. Verbal praise was also used consistently to reinforce appropriate behaviors and task engagement.

At the conclusion of the session, the RBT collected the client’s behavioral data. No medical or safety concerns arose during the session. During the next session, the RBT will continue working on the client’s behavior treatment plan (BTP) goals and objectives.
